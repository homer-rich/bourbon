## 1812 Blended Bourbon

### Twin Valley Distilleries

Combining both single cask bourbons, the 1812 Bourbon is a great crowd-pleaser. With all the bourbon notes you're looking for 
on the front end, this bourbon is the perfect thing for your next cocktail.

Twin Valley Distillers’ 1812 Maryland Bourbon Whiskey is aged across two different American oak barrels, providing subtle aromatic hints of caramel and vanilla. This Maryland-made whiskey has a balanced flavor of creamed corn, vanilla, and licorice, with a pepper graham cracker finish. 

* Color: Brown
* Aroma: Caramel, Vanilla
* Taste: Corn, Vanilla, Licorice

## Filibuster

### Filibuster Distillery

Mashbill: 70% Corn, 20% Rye, 10% Malted Barley

* Right from the start the wine barrel finishing is noticeable, but nowhere near overpowering. It adds a gentle layer of sweetness and red fruit aroma to the nose and doesn’t drastically overpower the whiskey’s other notes of vanilla, pine, cherry and light grain. 
* A cherry cola, vanilla, caramel, and black cherry comprise a palate that noticeably has a thin mouthfeel. 
* There is slight heat on the finish that presents clean and crisp notes of mild spice, burnt caramel, and light grape.

## Matchstick

### McClintock Distilling Company

The Matchstick Straight bourbon is a Maryland twist on a Kentucky classic. With a mashbill of organic non-gmo grains that are 
stone-milled in house this bourbon is bursting with flavor but finishes impossibly smooth. This wheated, rye finished Bourbon 
is less sweet than your traditional bourbon with a buttery mouthfeel that you can enjoy neat, on ice or in your favorite cocktail. 

Tasting Notes
* Honey and figs explode off the nosing and open up with a bit of water to reveal vanilla, caramel and butterscotch.
* Bold tobacco and charcoal on the front end of the palate with a continuation of the vanilla and caramel through the body.
* Impossibly clean finish with a light hint of butterscotch that slightly lingers

## Ragged Branch

### Ragged Branch

Mashbill: 68% corn, 16% wheat, and 16% malted barley

Wheated Straight Bourbon

* Warmer and sweeter than our Signature Bourbon. Vanilla, caramel, and honey on the front with a hint of cinnamon. 
* The flavors build on the tongue, finishing long. After adding a few drops of water, some oak opens up on the nose along with some very pleasant almond character. Finishes smooth and sweet.
